## What is this?

DiscoPanel is a web-based Minecraft server + proxy + modpack manager. Built by someone who was tired of bloated control panels that require a PhD to operate and still manage to break at the worst possible moment.

## Why DiscoPanel?

Because managing Minecraft servers shouldn't be difficult:

- **Docker-powered** - Each server runs in its own container. No more "works on my machine" disasters
- **Multi-server** - Run vanilla, modded, different versions, whatever. They won't fight each other
- **Smart Proxy** - Players connect through custom hostnames. No more port gymnastics (though basic ports assignment is still available)
- **Modpack Support** - Native CurseForge integration that actually downloads the mods/modpacks you tell it to
- **Web UI** - Clean interface that doesn't look like it crawled out of 2003
- **Auto-everything** - Auto-start, auto-stop, auto-pause. Set it and forget it

## Quick Start

```bash

# Non-exhaustive list of requirements for building from source:
# 1. Go (v1.24.5 if that matters)
# 2. NodeJs + npm (for building front end)

# Clone it
git clone https://github.com/nickheyer/discopanel
cd discopanel

# Get npm deps and build frontend first
cd web/discopanel && npm install && npm run build && cd ../..

# Build backend and embed front end
go build -o discopanel cmd/discopanel/main.go

# Run it
./discopanel

# Open it
# http://localhost:8080
```

## Docker Run

```bash

docker run -d \
  --name discopanel \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  --network host \
  -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
  -v ./data:/app/data \
  -v ./backups:/app/backups \
  -v ./tmp:/app/tmp \
  -v ./config.yaml:/app/config.yaml:ro \
  -e DISCOPANEL_DATA_DIR=/app/data \
  -e DISCOPANEL_HOST_DATA_PATH="$(pwd)/data" \
  -e TZ=UTC \
  nickheyer/discopanel:latest
```

## Docker Compose (Recommended)

```yaml

services:
  discopanel:
    # build: .
    image: nickheyer/discopanel:latest
    container_name: discopanel
    restart: unless-stopped

    # Option 1 (RECOMENDED FOR SIMPLICITY): Use host network mode
    network_mode: host

    # Option 2 (MORE COMPLICATED, ONLY USE IF YOU NEEDED): Use bridge mode with port mapping (default)
    # ports:
    #   - "8080:8080"         # DiscoPanel web interface
    #   - "25565:25565"       # Minecraft port/proxy-port
    #   - "25565-25665:25565-25665/tcp" # Additional ports/proxy-ports if needed
    #   - "25565-25665:25565-25665/udp" # Also map UDP for some Minecraft features

    volumes:
      # Docker socket for managing containers
      - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock
  
      # IMPORTANT: This is where your server(s) data will be stored on the host.
      # You can set this to any path you'd like, but the path must exist AND you must use the same
      # absolute paths below for the below env vars (in the environment section at the bottom). Example:
      # DISCOPANEL_DATA_DIR=/app/data
      # DISCOPANEL_HOST_DATA_PATH=/home/user/data
      # (See environment)
      - /home/user/data:/app/data

      - ./backups:/app/backups
      - ./tmp:/app/tmp
      
      # Configuration file (optional, see config.example.yaml for all available options).
      - ./config.yaml:/app/config.yaml:ro
    environment:
      - DISCOPANEL_DATA_DIR=/app/data

      # IMPORTANT: THIS MUST BE SET TO THE SAME PATH AS THE SERVER DATA PATH IN "volumes" above
      - DISCOPANEL_HOST_DATA_PATH=/home/user/data
      - TZ=UTC

    # DONT FORGET THIS
    extra_hosts:
      - "host.docker.internal:host-gateway"
```

>> NOTE: Prebuilt binaries coming soon... but just use docker, you'll need it anyways. Ask for help in discord, we'd love to help.

## Features That Actually Matter

### Server Management
- Create servers in seconds with any Minecraft version
- Support for Forge, Fabric, Paper, Spigot, and every other mod loader that exists
- Live console access and log streaming
- RCON support for remote commands
- Automatic Java version selection (no more version hell, unless you are into that)

### Proxy System
- Can be enabled / disabled depending on your preference (disabled by default)
- Automatic routing based on hostname
- Multiple proxy listeners for different use cases
- Custom hostnames for each server (`survival.yourserver.com`, `creative.yourserver.com`)

>> NOTE: DNS needs a wildcard A record, like `*.yourserver.com` -> your IP

- Just one open port is required. No port forwarding nightmares

>> NOTE: With just the default proxy port 25565:25565 forwarded, you can host a virtually unlimited amount of servers

### Modpack Integration
- Direct CurseForge modpack installation
- Automatic mod downloading and updates
- Server pack support for easier distribution
- Manual mod uploads when automation fails

### Resource Management
- Per-server memory limits
- JVM flag optimization (Aikar's flags included)
- Automatic cleanup of orphaned containers
- Detached mode for persistent servers

### Security
- Can be enabled / disabled depending on your preference (disabled by default)
- Built-in user authentication system with role-based access
- Admin, Editor, and Viewer roles
- Recovery key system (because passwords get forgotten)
- Session management and JWT tokens

## Configuration

DiscoPanel uses a `config.yaml` file. Here's what matters:

```yaml
storage:
  data_dir: "./data/servers"
  backup_dir: "./data/backups"

proxy:
  enabled: true
  base_url: "minecraft.example.com"
  listen_ports: [25565]
```

>> NOTE: There are a metric ton worth of configurable settings for your DiscoPanel and the servers it hosts, they can all be setup here ahead of time

## Requirements

- Docker (obviously)
- Go 1.21+ (only if building from source)
- A functioning brain (optional but recommended)

## API

DiscoPanel has a full REST API if you're into that sort of thing:

```bash
# List servers
curl http://localhost:8080/api/v1/servers

# Create a server
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/v1/servers \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name":"My Server","mc_version":"1.20.1","mod_loader":"vanilla"}'

# Start a server
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/v1/servers/{id}/start
```

>> NOTE: See `internal/api/server.go` for all the routes, or join the discord and ask about it!
